    (NOTE: most of this functionality is not yet implemented)

    This launch file will be used to actually start the match, after
    final.launch sets up the environment. It will launch each team's script,
    wait 60 seconds of simulation time, and then pause gazebo physics and score
    the match based on the final state of the objects.
